## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js version 20.11.0 installed. This is necessary to run the project and its development server.

## Setting up the Project

To set up the project for development:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project's root directory, `flicksense-client`, using the command `cd flicksense-client`.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Security Note

Please note that the Google Cloud API Key is stored in an environment variable that is not included in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tatiane-leal/flicksense-server). Once the project is deployed, the deployment link will be shared here, making it easier to interact with the application.
